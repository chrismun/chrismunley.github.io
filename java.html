                <h1>What is Java</h1>
                <p>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the mid 1990s while he was working at Sun Microsystems. One main feature of java that sets it apart from others is that it is machine-independent, meaning that a Java program can be written and run on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Java is capable of running on any platform because a compiler is used to run it.</p>
                <p>The compiler takes java code and converts it into a code known as bytecode. The compiler also checks for syntax errors. If there are no errors, the compiler generates a new program based on your java code that is readable by a Java virtual machine (JVM). The JVM is where the Java program actually runs, since it translates the bytecode into machine code. JVM is part of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE). <div class="block yellow">It is not extremely important to understand compilers, bytecode, the JVM, or the JRE right now, but it is always good to know what you are actually working with.</div>Now that you know what Java is, let's jump right into it!</p>
            </div>



            <div id="starting">
                <h1>Getting started</h1>
                <p>What do I need to start making my own Java programs? Well, you need somewhere to write, compile, and run code. For this, you have a few options. The best place to program in Java is in an IDE. An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a simple piece of software that aids you in writing code.<div class="block blue">A few great IDE's include Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans. You cant go wrong with any of these.</div> An alternative to downloading an IDE is to go to <a href="repl.it/languages/java">repl.it/languages/java</a>, which basically serves as an online IDE where you can write, compile and run code. This option does not have as many features to aid you in writing code, but it will run code just the same. Once you have an IDE or a similar alternative, you are ready to learn Java!</p>

                <h1>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)</h1>
                <p>Object-oriented programming is a type of programming that uses the concept of classes and objects. It is a well known approach since we live in a world that is object oriented. Everywhere you look, there are objects, and each object has attributes that make them different from other objects. Classes define how an object will be constructed, then objects are actually created from these classes, which you manipulate in your program.</p>
                <div class="block blue">It is a good practice to relate new Java concepts to things in your daily life, as it helps you really understand what is going on.</div>
            </div> -->

            <div id="helloworld">
                <h1>Hello World</h1>
                <p>A hello world program is traditionally the first computer program that a beginning Java programmer writes.</p>
                <div class="block code">
                    <pre style="color:#000020;"><span style="color:#200080; font-weight:bold; ">public</span> <span style="color:#200080; font-weight:bold; ">class</span> HelloWorld <span style="color:#406080; ">{</span><br>    <span style="color:#200080; font-weight:bold; ">public</span> <span style="color:#200080; font-weight:bold; ">static</span> <span style="color:#7779bb; ">void</span> main<span style="color:#308080;">(</span><span style="color:#6679aa; font-weight:bold; ">String</span><span style="color:#308080; ">[</span><span style="color:#308080; ">]</span> args<span style="color:#308080; ">)</span> <span style="color:#406080; ">{</span><br>        <span style="color:#6679aa; font-weight:bold; ">System</span><span style="color:#308080; ">.</span>out<span style="color:#308080; ">.</span>println<span style="color:#308080; ">(</span><span style="color:#1060b6; ">"Hello World!"</span><span style="color:#308080; ">)</span><span style="color:#406080; ">;</span><br>    <span style="color:#406080;">}</span><br><span style="color:#406080;">}</span></pre>
                </div>
                <p>To begin writing a Java program, you must first make a class. This is done with "public class HelloWorld { }". In order to run a Java program, there must be a main method. "public static void main(String[] args) { }" is how you create a main method. Don't worry too much about what each term means now, we will go over that in depth later.</p>
                <div class="block blue"><p>To print something to the console in a Java program, you must use either "System.out.println()" or "System.out.print()". The only difference between the two is that the latter does not create a new line after printing whatever is inside the parentheses.</p></div>
            </div>

            <div id="comments">
                <h1>Comments</h1>
                <p>Before we get into specific details about java, we should talk about a good programming practice: commenting. Commenting your code is an essential part of being a good programmer. If you want to come back to your work later in time, you will be glad you used comments, as it will make your code so much easier to understand. If you ever collaborate with people in the future, you are going to want them to be able to understand your code. You can guide their thinking with comments. However, you shouldn't overcomment your code, as it can distract from the code and make harder. Only put comments where necessary and where it won't distract anyone. <div class="block green">Comments are ignored by the compiler; they are solely for the programmer.</div>Inline comments in Java are created with "//". Inline means that only the line that // is on will be commented out. Also, only things that come after // will be ignored by the compiler, and stuff that comes before it on the same line will be read as regular code.<br>The syntax for multi line comments in Java is "/* comments go here, across multiple lines */". You can start and close a comment section with /* and */. Anything in between these will be ignored. These type of comments can span across many lines. 
                <div class="block code">
                <pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'><span style='color:#3f7f59; '>// this is a single line comment</span><br><br>int i = 5; <span style='color:#3f7f59; '>// this is a comment after some code</span><br><br><span style='color:#3f7f59; '>/* </span><br><span style='color:#3f7f59; '>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;This is a multi line comment</span><span style='color:#3f7f59; '><br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;int i = 0; this code is ignored, will not affect the program</span><br><span style='color:#3f7f59; '>*/</span></pre>
                </div>
                <div class="block yellow">In many IDEs, if you highlight some text and hit "ctrl+/", all of the text will be commented out for you so you don't have to do it by hand. This is useful if you want to see how the code runs when you take out some code, but you don't wan't to remove the code for good.</div> </p>
            </div>

            <div id="variables">
                <h1>Variables</h1>
                <p>
                    Variables store data that can be used later. Each variable is given a name, or an identifier, that explains what the variable holds. Each variable has a type: <ul><li>int: stores whole numbers only ex. 12, 156, 8722</li><li>double: stores floating point numbers (decimals) and whole numbers ex. 3.1415, -2.0, 3.5</li><li>String: stores text such as "Hello World!". Text string are enclosed in double quotes.</li><li>boolean: stores true or false values only</li><li>char: char stands for character, and it holds only one character. chars are surrounded in single quotes.</li></ul>
                    <div class="block code"><pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>String name = "chris";<br><br>int grade = 12;<br><br>double gpa = 4.6;<br><br>boolean goodAtJava = true;<br><br>char grade = 'A';</pre></div>
                    <div class="block green">You can declare multiple variables of the same type on the same line: "int a = 5, b = 7, c = 9;" is competely valid.</div>
                    There are two general types of variable in Java: primitive and non-primitive. The main difference between these are the way data is stored. In a primitive variable, the data is stored directly in the variable, as you would imagine. With a non-primitive variable, the variable actually doesn't hold the data itself, but rather a reference to an object (they reference a specific memory location). Non-primitive data types are not defined by the programming language, but rather by the programmer, usually through classes. A non-primitive data type is usually just called an Object. Java has eight primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, char, boolean, double, and float.
                    <div class="block green">If a data type starts with a lower case letter (such as int, boolean, etc.), it is a primitive data type. Non-primitive type variables start with a captial letter (such as String).</div>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="operators">
                <h1>Operators</h1>
                <p>
                   Java provides many arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, and % perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations respectively. When using these math operations in java you must be aware of what type of variables you are working with, and how the operator will be interpreted.
                </p>
                <h3>'+' for Addition and Concatenation</h3>
                <p>The + operator has two functions: to add numeric quantities and to concatenate strings. When + is used on two numbers, they will be added together. However when you use + on String variables it concatenates them, or puts them together.
                <div class="block blue">
                A very important thing to note about the + operator is that if only one of the two operands (things being added together) is a String and the other is a number, the number will be converted to and treated as a String. It follows that "System.out.println("Health: " + playerHealth);" would work as you would expect, and you don't have to put quotes around the variable name or if it was an actual number, since it is converted to a string.<br><br>System.out.println("30 + 50 = " 30 + 50);    // this prints '30 + 50 = 3050'<br>If you wanted the + operator to work as a numerical operation, you could put () around 30 + 50 in the above print statement, since parentheses are treated with higher priority just as in a calculator or math class.
                </div></p>
                <h3>Subtraction and Multiplication</h3>
                <p>The - operator actually serves two purposes as well; it can be used as a regular math operator to subtract two numbers, and it can also be used to make a number negative.<br><br>The * symbol is simply a multiplication operator, for example 10 * 10 = 100.</p>
                <h3>Division with '/'</h3>
                <p>
                Division in Java is relatively straight forward. If you divide two integer numbers,the largerst whole number will be returned and any remainder will be forgotten. If one is a floating point, or decimal number, the result will be a decimal number. If you divide by zero in java, an exception will be thrown. The best way to learn what results you will get from dividing two numberic values is to go into your ide and test a bunch of situations out. You can only learn if you practice!
                </p>
                <h3>The modulus operator</h3>
                <p>I think the modulus operator scares a lot of new programmers because they have probably never seen it in a calculator or math class before. Thhe modulus % simply returns the remainder of a division. For example, 7 % 3 returns 1, and 12 % 3 returns 0.<br><br>A common way to use the modulus operator is to check if a number is even or a multiple of something: for example, any number % 2 will return either 0 or 1. If 0, the number is divisible by 2 and is an even number, else it is an odd number.
                </p>

                <h1>Decision-making basics</h1>
                <p>In this section we will discuss conditional statements which are the simplest way to make your program actually do more than one thing. They will make it so that your program can do something different than normal if a condition is satisfied.</p>
                <p>There are 2 types of conditional statements in Java, as in many other high-level programming languages. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If statements</li>
                    <li>Switches</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="block blue">
                    If statement blocks can look for more than one condition at a time. This is done by the use of else and else if statments as well as nested ifs.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div id="if">
                <h1>if</h1>
                <p>The if statement is the most basic conditional statement. If the condition is true, it will run the code inside the block. If the condition is not true, the code inside the block will not run. Take a look at this example:</p>
                <div class="block code">
                    <pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>int x = 10;<br><br>if( x < 20 ) {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("20 is greater than 10, so this will get printed");<br>}<br><br>if( x < 5 ) {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span style='color:#3f7f59; '>// any code here will NOT run because 5 is not greater than 10</span><br>}</pre>
                </div>
                <p>A lonely if statement would be used when you do not want to do anything special when a condition is not met.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="else">
                <h1>else and else if</h1>
                <p>If you do want to something different when the condition is false, you can use an else statement.</p>
                <div class="block code">
                    <pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>if( x == 17 ) {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("x was 17");<br>} else {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("in every other case this would be printed instead");<br>}</pre>
                </div>
                <p>In the event that you have more than one condition to check as well as an "else" fallback, you can use an else if block</p>
                <div class="block code">
                    <pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>if( x == 17 ) {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("x was 17");<br>} else if( x == 18 ){<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("x was 18");<br>} else {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("in every other case this would be printed instead");<br>}</pre>
                </div>
                <div class="block green">
                    Both if and else if can evaluate two conditions at a time using the && operator. For instance if( x < 10 && x > 8 ) { ... } will be true for a number like 8.2 or 9 but not 7.6 or 10.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div id="switch">
                <h1>Switches</h1>
                <p>A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.</p>
                <div class="block red">
                    A switch will continue looking even after it has found a match! You can use the optional break statements to stop this from happening.
                </div>
                <p>Switches in programming in general are a bit of a misnomer. You have to think of them a lot more like multi-track railway switches, rather than light switches, as there are usually a lot more cases than just 2.</p>
                <p>Also, it is worth bearing in mind that switches can only be used when you know exactly what sort of values you expect; they are no good for evaluating if a value has a certain property. For instance, they will happily check if your string is "hello world", but will me useless for checking if your string has 11 characters.</p>
                <p>The "default" case will be used if no other match was found.</p>
                <div class="block code">
                    <pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>switch(name) {<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;case "Chris" :<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("Awesome name Chris!");<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;case "Aidan" :<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("Nice one Aidan!");<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;default :<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;System.out.println("You have some other name.");<br>}</pre>
